# This is a placeholder for the pip.wav file
# In a real experiment, you would include an actual audio file here
# The pip sound should be a brief (50-100ms) tone, typically around 1000Hz
# 
# To create the actual audio file, you could:
# 1. Use audio editing software like Audacity to generate a brief tone
# 2. Use online tone generators
# 3. Record a brief "pip" or "beep" sound
# 
# The file should be named "pip.wav" and placed in this directory
