# audio-visual-button-response plugin

## Overview

This plugin allows for displaying an image and playing an audio file simultaneously, and records responses generated with a button click. The included parameters allow for adjustment of trial duration, visual stimuli size, time delay before the button can be interacted with and more. The trial can be set to end when a button response is received or after the audio stimuli is finished playing.
